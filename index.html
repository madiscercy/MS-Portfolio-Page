            <p class="aboutme">
                Hello! My name is Madison Scercy, and I am 24 years old. I have a cat named Puma and a boyfriend named John. I'm an Aquarius and was born on groundhog's day! I love anything creative, I grew up spending most of my time drawing and being in love with art. At 21 I got my license to become an esthetician and had a job being both a makeup artist and a skin therapist for two years. I have celiac disease which means I'm allergic to gluten, so I had to learn how to cook every meal for myself and totally fell in love with cooking too. I've always loved computers and technology, so I'm very excited to be in this bootcamp and learn about coding!
